      Cray MPICH 8.1.28:
      =======================================
      
      Release Date:
      -------------
        November 16, 2023
      
      
      Purpose:
      --------
        Cray MPICH 8.1.28 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
        and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
          
        Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.28 from the XC Cray MPICH include:
      
            - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
              support.
      
            - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran
      
            - Does not support C++ language bindings
      
        New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:
            - Starting from the 8.1.26 release, Cray MPICH supports the Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU HBM 
              processor architecture.
      
            - On systems with AMD GPUs, Cray MPICH 8.1.26 supports all ROCm
              versions starting from ROCm 5.0, including the latest ROCm 5.5.0 
              release. 
       
              The Cray MPICH 8.1.25 release and prior versions of 
              Cray MPICH are only compatible with ROCm versions up to (and 
              including) the ROCm 5.4.0 release.
      
            - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
              This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
              Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.
      
            - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
              version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
              a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
              details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
              selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
              environment variables documented in the mpi man page.
      
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
              MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS
      
            - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
              Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
              the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
              reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
              assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
              between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
              By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
              allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
              However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
              may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
              manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
              the mpi man page.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
              with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
              and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
              more information including relevant environment variables reference
              the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.
      
            - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

      Notes and Limitations:
      ----------------------
        Limitations in Cray MPICH 8.1.28:
      
            - Cray MPICH 8.1.28 can support only ~2040 simultaneous MPI
              communicators.  This limit is less the XC Cray MPICH limit of
              ~4090 simultaneous communicators.  Cray intends to raise the
              limit in a future release of Cray MPICH for Shasta to at least
              the XC limit.

      Cray MPICH 8.1.28:
      =======================================
      
      Release Date:
      -------------
        November 16, 2023
      
      
      Purpose:
      --------
        Cray MPICH 8.1.28 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
        and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
          
        Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.28 from the XC Cray MPICH include:
      
            - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
              support.
      
            - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran
      
            - Does not support C++ language bindings
      
        New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:
            - Starting from the 8.1.26 release, Cray MPICH supports the Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU HBM 
              processor architecture.
      
            - On systems with AMD GPUs, Cray MPICH 8.1.26 supports all ROCm
              versions starting from ROCm 5.0, including the latest ROCm 5.5.0 
              release. 
       
              The Cray MPICH 8.1.25 release and prior versions of 
              Cray MPICH are only compatible with ROCm versions up to (and 
              including) the ROCm 5.4.0 release.
      
            - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
              This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
              Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.
      
            - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
              version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
              a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
              details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
              selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
              environment variables documented in the mpi man page.
      
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
              MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS
      
            - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
              Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
              the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
              reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
              assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
              between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
              By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
              allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
              However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
              may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
              manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
              the mpi man page.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
              with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
              and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
              more information including relevant environment variables reference
              the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.
      
            - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.

           New Features:
      
              - Cray MPICH 8.1.28 for aarch64 is in early stage of support and
                has some issues. Setting these variables will help circumvent most
                known issues.

      Cray MPICH 8.1.28:
      =======================================
      
      Release Date:
      -------------
        November 16, 2023
      
      
      Purpose:
      --------
        Cray MPICH 8.1.28 is based upon ANL MPICH 3.4a2 with support for libfabric
        and is optimized for the Cray Programming Environment.
          
        Major Differences Cray MPICH 8.1.28 from the XC Cray MPICH include:
      
            - Uses the new ANL MPICH CH4 code path and libfabric for network
              support.
      
            - Does not support -default64 mode for Fortran
      
            - Does not support C++ language bindings
      
        New Cray MPICH features for HPE Cray EX and Apollo systems:
            - Starting from the 8.1.26 release, Cray MPICH supports the Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU HBM 
              processor architecture.
      
            - On systems with AMD GPUs, Cray MPICH 8.1.26 supports all ROCm
              versions starting from ROCm 5.0, including the latest ROCm 5.5.0 
              release. 
       
              The Cray MPICH 8.1.25 release and prior versions of 
              Cray MPICH are only compatible with ROCm versions up to (and 
              including) the ROCm 5.4.0 release.
      
            - Cray MPICH uses the libfabric "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider by default.
              This is the supported and optimized OFI libfabric provider for
              Slingshot-10 and Apollo systems.
      
            - Cray MPICH offers support for multiple NICs per node. Starting with
              version 8.0.8, by default Cray MPICH will use all available NICs on
              a node. Several rank-to-NIC assignment policies are supported. For
              details on choosing a policy for assigning ranks to NICS, or for
              selecting a subset of available NICs, please see the following
              environment variables documented in the mpi man page.
      
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_VERBOSE
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY
              MPICH_OFI_NIC_MAPPING
              MPICH_OFI_NUM_NICS
      
            - Enhancements to the MPICH_OFI_NIC_POLICY NUMA mode have been added.
              Starting with version 8.0.14, if the user selects the NUMA policy,
              the NIC closest to the rank is selected. A NIC no longer needs to
              reside in the same numa node as the rank. If multiple NICs are
              assigned to the same numa node, the local ranks will round-robin
              between them. Numa distances are analyzed to select the closest NIC.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports creating a full connection grid during MPI_Init.
              By default, OFI connections between ranks are set up on demand. This
              allows for optimal performance while minimizing memory requirements.
              However, for jobs requiring an all-to-all communication pattern, it
              may be beneficial to create all OFI connections in a coordinated
              manner at startup. See the MPICH_OFI_STARTUP_CONNECT description in
              the mpi man page.
      
            - Cray MPICH supports runtime switching to the UCX netmod starting
              with version 8.0.14. To do this load the craype-network-ucx module
              and module swap between Cray-MPICH and Cray-MPICH-UCX modules.  For
              more information including relevant environment variables reference
              the intro_mpi man page with the Cray-MPICH-UCX module loaded.
      
            - Lmod support for HPE Cray EX starting with Cray MPICH 8.0.16.
